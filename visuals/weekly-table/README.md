# ðŸ“… Weekly Table

---

## Overview

The **Weekly Table UI** is a simple, clean, and flexible layout for planning or tracking tasks, meals, routines, or any activities that repeat over a week.

It uses a **7-day grid**, where **one axis always represents the days of the week (Mondayâ€“Sunday)**, and the other axis can be customized to fit your needs â€” such as hours, time blocks (morning/afternoon/evening), tasks, or any custom category.

## Structure

* **X-axis or Y-axis**: Fixed to **7 days** (Mondayâ€“Sunday).
* **Other axis**: Flexible. For example:

  * **Time slots** (hours of the day)
  * **Parts of the day** (morning, afternoon, evening)
  * **Tasks or activities**
  * **People or rooms** (e.g., shifts or class schedules)

---

## Example Use Cases

* **Meal Planner**: Days on top, meals on the side (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner).
* **Workout Schedule**: Days on top, exercises or time blocks on the side.
* **Class Timetable**: Days on top, class periods or time slots on the side.
* **Daily Routine**: Days on the side, time blocks across the top.
* **Shift Planner**: Days on one axis, employees or shifts on the other.

## Design Principles

âœ… **Simple & Clear**
Easy to read and fill out â€” no clutter, just clean lines and clear sections.

âœ… **Print-Ready**
Designed to be printable on standard paper.
**No outer shadows** or heavy effects are used on the top-level container â€” shadows donâ€™t translate well to printed pages and can waste ink.

âœ… **Customizable**
You can adapt the non-day axis to any type of time block or category that suits your planning style.

## Printing Tips

* Use light or neutral colors for lines and cells.
* Avoid heavy background fills.
* Keep fonts legible and standard (e.g., Arial, Helvetica, or a clear serif).
* Leave enough margin space for hole-punching or binder placement if needed.
